My name is Brantley Kimpson. I am a cybersecurity-focused IT professional with a strong interest in artificial intelligence, automation, and data-driven problem solving. I am actively pursuing a career in cybersecurity with an AI specialization, supported by ongoing graduate studies toward a Master’s degree in Cybersecurity.
My background includes hands-on experience in IT support, system troubleshooting, and operational security fundamentals, with a growing focus on secure system design, scripting, and defensive security concepts. I enjoy working at the intersection of technology, data, and security, where analytical thinking and creativity come together to solve real-world problems.
On GitHub, I use projects to strengthen my skills in Python, security tooling, automation, and applied AI, while documenting my learning and experimentation through practical, security-minded solutions. I’m driven by curiosity, continuous improvement, and the challenge of building secure, efficient, and intelligent systems.
